Circe is a Client for IRC in Emacs. It integrates well with the rest
of the editor, using standard Emacs key bindings and indicating
activity in channels in the status bar so it stays out of your way
unless you want to use it.

Complexity-wise, it is somewhere between rcirc (very minimal) and ERC
(very complex).

Once installed, you should be able to simply use M-x circe to
connect to IRC. See the wiki on the project homepage for a more
elaboration configuration options.
